# Tinypool - the node.js worker pool üßµ

> Piscina: A fast, efficient Node.js Worker Thread Pool implementation

<<<<<<< HEAD
Tinypool is a fork of piscina. What we try to achieve in this library, is to eliminate some dependencies and features that our target users don't need (currently, our main user will be Vitest). Tinypool's install size (38KB) can then be smaller than Piscina's install size (6MB). If you need features like [utilization](https://github.com/piscinajs/piscina#property-utilization-readonly) or OS-specific thread priority setting, [Piscina](https://github.com/piscinajs/piscina) is a better choice for you. We think that Piscina is an amazing library, and we may try to upstream some of the dependencies optimization in this fork.
